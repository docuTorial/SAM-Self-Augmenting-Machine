It could also use a pyWebGui for chat.
It needs to be robust to be useful.
Checking if it is working now. :D
I talked with the bot without recording for a few minutes.

I wonder what will happen now when it attemps to update itself. :)

Seems to be done, maybe.
There are two main changes that are needed for quality of life.
(1) Sam should be able to run short python scripts - code bits, directly.
(2) Sam should know about all the verbs and actions it can take and actively decide to use them.

OK, it updated its own code for the first time. This is exciting!
