2024-10-04 20:44:06,564 - INFO - Assistant extracted requirements: To address the issues you mentioned, let's follow these steps:

1. **Check Current Permission Policy**: First, I'll examine the current implementation to see how permissions are handled.
2. **Adjust Permission Logic**: Update the logic to allow writing new files and executing Python files without explicit permission.
3. **Commit Changes**: Finally, commit any changes to git.

Let's start by reviewing the current code to identify where these permissions are managed. Could you please tell me which file(s) contain the code relevant to managing permissions?
