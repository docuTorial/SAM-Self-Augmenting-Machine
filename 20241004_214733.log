2024-10-04 21:53:41,328 - User input: Modify your code. First include a new verb for update self and name it however you want. Second, commit your code to git if there are changes that haven't been comitted yet as soon as you are ran. Third, before saving new changes to git, attempt to run the new version, write some tests for it, run the tests, make sure it is good. Now, here is the deal: you'll need to extract your functionality into an API that can be tested by a test module. You will call that functionality in the main script. However, it will all be stand-alone and completely testable, reproducable and not hard code to use input() or whatever is there now. Same thing with print, you'll create two functions, one for 'say' and one for 'info' and their current implemntation in your current version will be to print. In the future, they might do some cool stuff in a chat GUI. OK? OH, also, in your system message, make sure you are aware that you can update your code with that new verb. Also! Add a file for a custom personality. call it custom_persona.txt and load it if it exists. Explain it in your readme and .gitignore that file. :D

2024-10-04 21:53:50,782 - Requirements extracted: Understood. Let's break down the steps and implement these changes systematically.

### Task Breakdown:
1. **Add a New Verb for Self-Update:**
   - Implement a function that allows the code to update itself.
   - Name this function creatively (e.g., `self_upgrade`).

2. **Git Integration:**
   - Check for uncommitted changes.
   - Commit changes to git automatically when the script is run.

3. **Testing and Validation Process:**
   - Refactor the functionality into an API form that can be tested independently.
   - Write test cases for the API and ensure they pass before committing changes to git.

4. **Create Utility Functions for Output:**
   - Implement `say()` and `info()` functions to encapsulate `print()` functionality.

5. **Personality Customization:**
   - Create a `custom_persona.txt` file that can customize the assistant's personality.
   - Load this file if it exists, and update the README and `.gitignore` accordingly.

6. **Update System Message:**
   - Inform that the assistant can be upgraded using the new verb.

### Implementation Steps:

#### Step 1: Create a New Verb for Self-Update
I'll define a method `self_upgrade` that can later potentially pull updates from a repository or update the internal logic as required.

#### Step 2: Set Up Git Auto-Commit
Incorporate logic to check the git status, add changes, commit them with a message, and additionally push to a repository if needed.

#### Step 3: Refactor to API Form
We’ll modularize the current implementation into API-like callable functions.

#### Step 4: Implement `say()` and `info()`
Create simple wrappers for `print()` to prepare for future GUI interactions.

#### Step 5: Load Custom Personality
Modify the code to read from `custom_persona.txt` if available and adjust the personality accordingly.

#### Step 6: Update System Message
I'll adjust the system message to indicate knowledge of the new `self_upgrade` capability.

Let's start implementing these changes. I'll use commands to simulate a development environment and process. 

```python
# Step 1: Define new verb in assistant class
def self_upgrade():
    """ New feature for self updating functionality. """
    # Placeholder logic for update
    print("Self-upgrade feature is initiated.")
```

Let's now list the files and work through modifying them as needed.

2024-10-04 21:56:40,197 - Assistant response: According to semantic versioning, version numbers are in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- **MAJOR** version increases indicate incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version increases indicate backward-compatible functionality improvements.
- **PATCH** version increases indicate backward-compatible bug fixes.

Given the described changes:

1. **New functionality:** The addition of a self-update capability, integration with git for auto-commits, new utility functions (`say()`, `info()`), and loading of a custom personality indicate new features that do not break existing functionality.

2. **Refactoring:** The refactoring into an API form that can be independently tested and the addition of test cases also suggest improvements and enhancements.

3. **Updating system message and README:** Not strictly a feature or bug fix, but it complements the changes above.

Because these changes are substantial improvements and additions of new functionality that are backward-compatible, the appropriate increment would be the **MINOR** version number.

Given the current version is `0.1.0`, and these changes introduce new features, the next version number should be **0.2.0**. The MAJOR version remains at `0` since no backward-incompatible changes were mentioned, and the PATCH version remains at `0` since no bug fixes were noted.
