# Features and Recent Changes (Version Based on the changes described, there seem to be no modifications made to the functionality, API, or bug fixes; rather, it is a request for review and potential code improvements without any actual changes detailed. According to semantic versioning:

- **Major version** is incremented for incompatible API changes.
- **Minor version** is incremented when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Patch version** is incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

Since no changes have been specified, the version number remains the same. If no actual functional changes, additions, or fixes were made to the code, the next version would still be `0.1.0`. If, after review, improvements like refactoring or optimization were made that didn't alter the current functionality or API, the version might still not need to change. If minor functionality is added or changes are identified later after the review, then the minor version might increment to `0.2.0`. Otherwise, the default remains `0.1.0`.)

It seems like you want me to review or update the code in a file named `chatbot.py`. While I can't directly access files on your system or any external systems, I can help you update or debug the code if you share it with me here. 

Just copy and paste the relevant code you need help with, and I'll assist in identifying issues or suggesting improvements.
