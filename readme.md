# Features and Recent Changes (Version Based on the changes you've described, it seems that these modifications involve adjusting some of the internal logic related to the handling of permissions. Since these types of changes are typically considered as internal improvements or bug fixes that do not add new features or modify existing functionality visible to users, they are usually classified as "patch" updates in semantic versioning.

Therefore, the update would increment the patch version, resulting in the next version being 0.1.1.)

To address the issues you mentioned, let's follow these steps:

1. **Check Current Permission Policy**: First, I'll examine the current implementation to see how permissions are handled.
2. **Adjust Permission Logic**: Update the logic to allow writing new files and executing Python files without explicit permission.
3. **Commit Changes**: Finally, commit any changes to git.

Let's start by reviewing the current code to identify where these permissions are managed. Could you please tell me which file(s) contain the code relevant to managing permissions?
