# Features and Recent Changes (Version 0.1.0)

Understood. Let's break down the steps and implement these changes systematically.

### Task Breakdown:
1. **Add a New Verb for Self-Update:**
   - Implement a function that allows the code to update itself.
   - Name this function creatively (e.g., `self_upgrade`).

2. **Git Integration:**
   - Check for uncommitted changes.
   - Commit changes to git automatically when the script is run.

3. **Testing and Validation Process:**
   - Refactor the functionality into an API form that can be tested independently.
   - Write test cases for the API and ensure they pass before committing changes to git.

4. **Create Utility Functions for Output:**
   - Implement `say()` and `info()` functions to encapsulate `print()` functionality.

5. **Personality Customization:**
   - Create a `custom_persona.txt` file that can customize the assistant's personality.
   - Load this file if it exists, and update the README and `.gitignore` accordingly.

6. **Update System Message:**
   - Inform that the assistant can be upgraded using the new verb.

### Implementation Steps:

#### Step 1: Create a New Verb for Self-Update
I'll define a method `self_upgrade` that can later potentially pull updates from a repository or update the internal logic as required.

#### Step 2: Set Up Git Auto-Commit
Incorporate logic to check the git status, add changes, commit them with a message, and additionally push to a repository if needed.

#### Step 3: Refactor to API Form
We’ll modularize the current implementation into API-like callable functions.

#### Step 4: Implement `say()` and `info()`
Create simple wrappers for `print()` to prepare for future GUI interactions.

#### Step 5: Load Custom Personality
Modify the code to read from `custom_persona.txt` if available and adjust the personality accordingly.

#### Step 6: Update System Message
I'll adjust the system message to indicate knowledge of the new `self_upgrade` capability.

Let's start implementing these changes. I'll use commands to simulate a development environment and process. 

```python
# Step 1: Define new verb in assistant class
def self_upgrade():
    """ New feature for self updating functionality. """
    # Placeholder logic for update
    print("Self-upgrade feature is initiated.")
```

Let's now list the files and work through modifying them as needed.
